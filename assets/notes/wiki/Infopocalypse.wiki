= Infopocalypse notes =
    * Play as 1 of x factions in what is essentially the matrix but an early rendition. Not everything has been implemented yet. Hackers are n the rise to steal as much information as they can and take over the entire system
    * Humans never bothered to plan ahead so there is no law inside this matrix, Should people have human rights here?
    * Drug that modifies dna so your nervous system can be turned into binary plug in through cp2077 style wire in the wrist, can then upload your nervous system and eye receptors to experience another "world" from your own body
    * A law was passed so that you can't be fully uploaded
    * The fact that we can translate human to computer makes the need for lawyers doctors etc to be obsolete as dead ones that were uploaded to the matrix exist on as sort of slaves to humanity.
    * The real world became autonomous years ago, typical quality of life in the real world has gone down dramatically.
    * Dont force the story on the player, start with a "hey, wake up"
    * Not traditional computer rendering, It had to be reimagined for the brain so most 3d rendering is rewritten
    * Programming language for this computer to brain stuff, working name: Br4in Try make it an acronym, possibly a recursive one
    * Character that wrote the library. Then started the company that invented the converter.
    * How much memory can a brain store 2.5 Petabytes. Eventually people needed upgrades
    * Huge firewall to stop anything being uploaded to peoples brains. Faction trying to bypass that and turn people into their personal slaves. Jonestown type deal whereby they hack into someones brain and then essentially shut off theirr nervous system.
