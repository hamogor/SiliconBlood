=== Basic Concepts ===
    * Companions
      * 3 companions each with their own abilities, skill tree, areas of expertise and lore
    * Fillable pokedex style journal 
      * First encounter with anything (weapon, ability, enemy) gives short description until identified
      * Companions have specific skills and areas where they can help identify things in their area of expertise
      * Different levels of knowledge on something grant new traits (ie level 2 of "skeleton" allows alternate use of their bones")
